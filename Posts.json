[{"id":1,"title":"A beginner breakdown on programming with Rust","body":"So, Rust is built on 3 major ideas: memory safety, safe multithreading (no crashy thingy like stuff), and zero-cost abstractions. Basically, you get to write code that looks clean and is high-level, but when it runs, itâ€™s as fast as the godfathers of the programming languages yaani C/C++ code. The difference? Unlike C/C++, Rust doesnâ€™t troll you with dumb memory bugs that brutally grapes (crashes, bricks,etc) your whole program.  \nYou donâ€™t really need prerequisites to learn it tho. If youâ€™re decent or even have a lil grasp with C, toh you're gonna be alright,  Rust will feel kinda similar.  \nPerformance? Rust is peak gng. It's as good as C++ and completely claps them zesty cheeks of slower high-level stuff like Python or JavaScript. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s a W for game engines, high-performance apps, or anything where speed = meta.  \nThe ownership system wala system is the big daddyðŸ‘…ðŸ’¦. It deletes a whole bunch of bugs other devs cry over:  \n- No memory leaks or dangling pointers (C devs cry about these daily).  \n- No buffer overflows or null pointer showing you their chuttad.  \n- No data races when youâ€™re running multi-threads (borrow checker = Lewis Hamilton (( yaani peakkkk)) ).  \nThe borrow checker is lowkey both a buff and a nerf. Itâ€™s cracked because it:  \n- Smokes memory safety issues before your code even launches.  \n- Stops you from inting your data sharing in threads.  \n- Throws garbage collection out the window but still keeps your memory safe. \n### Rust vs Python vs JavaScript for Discord bots\n- **Memory footprint**: Rust bots usually takes 15â€“25MB, Python bots usually at 50â€“80MB.  \n- **Speed**: Rust bots = multitaskes, handle way more tasks.  \n- **Stability**: Python bots starts strong but thode time baad they tend to slow down\nRustâ€™s Discord library is **Serenity**Itâ€™s a humongous w like my big veiny dihh because:  \n- Covers everything (slash commands, voice thingy, buttons, etc).  \n- Built on Tokio = async goated  for multitasking.  \n- Strong typing = less runtime ke chochle compared to Python/JS.  \nWhen should you pick Rust for bots:  \n- Huge servers with big traffic.  \n- A lot of data processing or math-heavy bots.  \n- Bots that need to labour 24/7 like cse passouts with no memory waste.  \n- Projects where runtime errors canâ€™t happen unless you wanna wipe.  \nWhen Python/JS are the ez W when:  \n- Speedrunning prototypes.  \n- Bots that just reply with text = light work.  \n- Teams that just need something running asap and donâ€™t care about max performance.  \n### Rust Pros (buffs)\n- Lewis motherfucking Hamilton yaani fast asf with no runtime packet loss or hosting shit (pretty common with python bots I can assure you bhai, I've made multiple python bots, like 50+ until now and python bots tend to break down jyada as compared to javascript or bots built on other languages due to I think, I'm not sure but I think cache overlap issue, ram integrity issue or shit like that but that problem must not exist in Rust bots kyuki it is a language just above assembly yaani almost touching the hardware components so less packet loss or cache audit issues ig not sure tho).  \n- C/C++ levels of power, minus their ðŸ¥€ðŸ’” bugs.  \n- Great at handling threads (no crashes = no rage quits).  \n- Compiler = Tells your ass where you got cooked.  \n- Cargo package manager = ggs.  \n- Strong typing means fewer dumb runtime ints.  \n- Already meta at big tech companies.  \n- Cross-platform = deploy anywhere.  \n### Rust Cons (nerfs)- Compile times are slow asf.  \n- Prototyping speed = L compared to Python/JS.  \n- Learning curve is like them sweaty balls, stinky and putrid at first lekin after you're experienced you kinda start like to sniff it ((not speaking from personal experience I swear)) (borrow checker makes noobs rage quit tho cuz ts is complicated as for beginners mujhe bhi bas thoda thoda samajh aaya abhi tak).  \n- Some crates still are thode trashy.  \n- Updates can randomly break old code (usual compatibility issues for newer languages, functions and libraries.  \n- Compilation eats RAM = IDE can slow down aur even lag thoda. \n### When Rust Is Goated?  \n- High-performance apps (OS building, game engines, blockchains, network servers).  \n- Safety is critical.  \n- Long-running services that canâ€™t afford leaks or crashes = w consistency.  \n### When not to use Rust?\n- If you want to build something quick, like freestyle coding if that exists idk.  \n- CRUD web apps (boring and slow stuff, Python wins in that department).  \n- If your needed libs exist only in other ecosystems.  \n- Data science/ML = Python solos.  \n- Quick scripts/basic sites = Python/JS = the easy win imo.\n### Debugging & Error Handling  \n- Compiler messages are clean asf, with actual fixes included.  \n- `rustc --explain` = like patch notes for errors.  \n- Turn on `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for stack traces.  \n- `dbg!` macro = free wallhacks for debug info.  \n- Normal debuggers (GDB/LLDB) still work.","tags":["Programming","CS"],"votes":0,"createdAt":"2025-09-28T00:00:00.000Z"}]
